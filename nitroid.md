I'd like to announce the release of an English Patch of Desunoya's puzzle/platform game, Fantasy Explorer Nitroid! by our circle Talkhaus Fansubs.

Huge thanks to everyone involved it was a lot of work and I hope you enjoy.

For more information about the game see, the trailer or the game's <a href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Gensou_Tansaku_Nitroid!">Touhouwiki</a> entry.

Post in the <a href="https://talkhaus.raocow.com/viewtopic.php?t=2495">the thread</a> to discuss it or offer feedback (although it's pretty old at this rate so there probably won't be another version)

### *please note*

The English patch is only compatible with the most up to date version of Nitroid! 1.10. If you haven't patched your copy of the game, please do so before running the installer. The patch can be found <a href="http://srplus.sakura.ne.jp/ntr_110.zip">here</a>.
